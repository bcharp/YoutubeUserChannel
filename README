Licence : Whatever You Want (but based on SDImageCache and JSONKit)

Absolutely No warranty of any kind.

There is 3 view, one who list all the video of a user, one with the touchable
video (launch the video player) and comments.
And one to enter a Youtube user name.

This is a simple test app, that just take a name
of a youtube account in parameter and show all is videos and comments
in a detailView.
The Youtube fun code is under the Youtube group, YoutubeConnection, who
take in charge the API Calls, YoutubeEntry, the basic video feed object
(simplify to my need) and YoutubeCom basic object for comments API.

The app only works on iOS 4.0+ because of some blocks, I didn't wanted to
do a delegate for the Asynchronous call, that was a lot more fun with 
blocks  (again this is an app done with in mind the purpose of testing).

Youtube video doesnt work under the simulator.
